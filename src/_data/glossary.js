    term: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)",
    shortDef: "An AI architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce accurate, context-aware responses.",
    definition: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture pattern that enhances large language models by connecting them to external knowledge sources. When a user asks a question, the system first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses that context to generate an accurate response. RAG solves the hallucination problem common in pure LLMs by grounding responses in verified information. This approach is widely used for enterprise chatbots, document Q&A systems, and customer support automation.",

    shortDef: "An AI model trained on massive text datasets that can understand and generate human-like text.",
    definition: "A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence trained on billions of words from books, websites, and documents. LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama can understand context, answer questions, write content, and assist with complex tasks. They work by predicting the most likely next word in a sequence, but at scale, this creates emergent capabilities like reasoning and code generation. Businesses use LLMs for customer support, content creation, code assistance, and process automation.",

    term: "Vector Database",
    shortDef: "A database optimized for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors, enabling semantic search and AI applications.",
    definition: "A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). Unlike traditional databases that match exact keywords, vector databases find semantically similar content. When text is converted to vectors using embedding models, similar concepts cluster together in vector space. This enables semantic search, recommendation systems, and RAG applications. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and pgvector for PostgreSQL.",

    term: "Semantic Search",
    shortDef: "Search technology that understands the meaning and intent behind queries, not just keyword matching.",
    definition: "Semantic search is a search approach that understands the meaning and intent behind user queries rather than just matching keywords. Using embeddings and natural language processing, semantic search can find relevant results even when the exact words don't match. For example, a search for 'affordable housing' would also return results about 'low-cost apartments' or 'budget-friendly rentals.' This technology powers modern search experiences in enterprise knowledge bases, e-commerce, and customer support systems.",

    shortDef: "Coordinating multiple AI models, tools, and services to work together in complex workflows.",
    definition: "AI orchestration refers to coordinating multiple AI models, tools, and external services to work together in complex workflows. Rather than a single model handling everything, orchestration systems route tasks to specialized components—one model for understanding intent, another for retrieval, another for generation. Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex enable orchestration patterns. This approach improves reliability, enables complex multi-step reasoning, and allows mixing different AI capabilities.",

    shortDef: "The basic unit of text that AI models process, roughly equivalent to 4 characters or 0.75 words.",
    definition: "A token is the basic unit of text that AI language models process. Tokenization breaks text into subword units that the model can understand. In English, one token roughly equals 4 characters or 0.75 words. 'Artificial intelligence' might be 3 tokens: 'Art', 'ificial', 'intelligence'. Token counts matter because they determine costs (APIs charge per token) and context limits. Understanding tokenization helps optimize prompts and estimate API costs.",

    definition: "Zero-shot learning refers to an AI model's ability to perform tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, without being given examples. Modern large language models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities—you can ask them to translate, summarize, or classify text without fine-tuning. This contrasts with traditional machine learning, which required task-specific training data. Zero-shot capability makes LLMs versatile tools, though performance often improves with examples (few-shot) or fine-tuning.",

    id: "few-shot-learning",
    term: "Few-shot Learning",
    shortDef: "Teaching an AI model new tasks by providing just a few examples in the prompt.",
    definition: "Few-shot learning is a technique where an AI model learns to perform a task from just a few examples provided in the prompt. Instead of fine-tuning on thousands of examples, you include 2-5 demonstrations of the desired input-output pattern. The model generalizes from these examples to handle new inputs. Few-shot prompting is more reliable than zero-shot for complex tasks and more practical than fine-tuning when data is limited or tasks change frequently.",
